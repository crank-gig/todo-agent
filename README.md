# todo-agent
Hello Agent is a minimal, educational CLI project that demonstrates the core mechanics of agentic AI in practice.  The agent reads a TODO comment from a Python file, uses an LLM to generate a code patch, applies the change, runs tests, and reports success or failure — forming a complete intent → action → observation loop.
